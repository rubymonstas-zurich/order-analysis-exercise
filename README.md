## Tasks

This exercise has 3 Ruby files and 2 CSV files. The idea is to load the data from the CSV files and "glue" them together in Ruby classes.

The file `order_analysis.rb` is supposed to be executed. It already contains an example how to read data from one of the CSV files. Before you continue, execute this script **now** and have a look at the output. Also try to follow what happens in the existing code.


**Have you executed the script and analysed the output and the script?**

If yes, please continue... :wink:

From there we'd like to implement following things:

* [ ] Implement a `Customer` class (see `customer.rb`) where we "store"  data from `customers.csv`.
* [ ] Implement an `Order` class (see `order.rb`) where we "store" data from `orders.csv`.
* [ ] In `order_analysis.rb`, find and attach all loaded `Order` objects to the corresponding `Customer` objects. At the end each `Customer` object should have a list of `Orders`.
* [ ] Create a report that prints all customers and their orders in a fancy way (see example below).
* [ ] Make a report that list the customers ranked by their expenses (see example below).

## Need Guidance?

If you feel lost and require some sort of _"Guidance"_, there's a document that helps you go through the exercise step by step. Use it on your own responsibility.
